# Resource Extractor 
A Fabric mod that let's you extract Minecraft's resources into files like .json, .png, .txt, etc, for you to use wherever you want.

This originated because I needed an automated way to extract both item's icons and make a list of all items in the game 

This is, at the moment, a very crude mod without any GUI. It does it's job in a simple and crude way.
  
##  Features

- [x] **Export item's icons to .PNG. Current dimensions: *16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72,80, 88, 96, 104, 112, 120, 128, 136,144, 152, 160, 168, 176, 184, 192, 200,208, 216, 224, 232, 240, 248, 256*;**
- [ ] Export entity's icons to .PNG;
- [x] **Export item plain .txt list (easy copy-paste into Sheets or something);**
- [x] **Export item JSON list with IDs, names (as in-game) and snake-lower case names (like_this_example): mainly to add to a database.**

##  Usage
 
Use command: **/dae all**

Images and lists, for now, are being exported inside **/screenshots/**.
